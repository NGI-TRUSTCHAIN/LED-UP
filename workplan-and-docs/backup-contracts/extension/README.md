# LED-UP Smart Contract Extensions

This directory contains extended implementations of the core contracts with additional functionality.

## Overview

The extension contracts build upon the core contracts to provide additional features and functionality. They inherit from the core contracts and add new capabilities while maintaining compatibility with the existing interfaces.

## Contracts

### DidRegistryExtended

Extends the core DID registry with additional features:

- DID metadata management
- DID delegate management
- Signed DID operations

### DataRegistryExtended

Extends the core data registry with additional features:

- Data metadata management
- Data access control
- Signed data operations

### AuthenticationExtended

Extends the core authentication contract with additional features:

- Authentication sessions
- Authentication with credentials
- Authentication history

### CompensationExtended

Extends the core compensation contract with additional features:

- Compensation rates
- Compensation periods
- Participant statistics

### ConsentManagementExtended

Extends the core consent management contract with additional features:

- Consent purposes
- Extended consent information
- Consent history

## Usage

These extension contracts can be used as drop-in replacements for the core contracts, providing all the same functionality plus additional features. They maintain backward compatibility with the core contracts while offering enhanced capabilities.

## Implementation Notes

- All extension contracts inherit from their respective core contracts
- Additional storage variables are defined to support the extended functionality
- New events are emitted for the extended operations
- Error handling is enhanced with custom error types
- Gas optimization techniques are applied where possible

## Deployment

When deploying these contracts, use the same constructor parameters as the core contracts. The extension contracts will initialize their parent contracts with these parameters.

## Security Considerations

- The extension contracts maintain the same security model as the core contracts
- Access control is preserved and extended where necessary
- Signature verification is used for sensitive operations
- Timestamp validation is applied to prevent replay attacks
- Nonce tracking is implemented to prevent double-spending
