# FHIR Record Registration with Blockchain and Secure IPFS Storage

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for registering FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) records using blockchain technology and secure IPFS storage. The system will allow healthcare professionals to register patient health records securely, ensuring data integrity, privacy, and controlled access.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend Forms**: React components for capturing FHIR resource data
2. **Encryption Layer**: Symmetric encryption for securing sensitive health data
3. **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized storage for encrypted health records
4. **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contract interactions for record registration and access control
5. **Data Verification**: Hashing mechanisms to ensure data integrity

## Data Flow

1. Healthcare professional fills out a FHIR resource form (Patient, Procedure, etc.)
2. Form data is validated and prepared for storage
3. Data is encrypted using symmetric encryption
4. Encrypted data is uploaded to IPFS
5. IPFS returns a Content Identifier (CID)
6. Data hash is calculated for verification purposes
7. Record metadata (CID, URL, hash) is registered on the blockchain
8. Confirmation is displayed to the user

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Record Registration Page

Create a page that:

- Allows selection of FHIR resource type
- Loads the appropriate form component
- Handles form submission
- Manages the registration workflow

### 2. Data Processing Service

Implement a service that:

- Takes form data
- Generates a unique record ID
- Prepares data for encryption and storage

### 3. Secure Storage Implementation

Implement functions that:

- Encrypt data using SymmetricCryptoService
- Upload encrypted data to IPFS using IPFSService
- Calculate data hash using HashingService
- Return metadata for blockchain registration

### 4. Blockchain Integration

Implement functions that:

- Prepare ProducerRegistrationParam with required fields
- Call useRegisterProducerRecord hook to register the record on blockchain
- Handle transaction responses and errors

### 5. User Interface Components

Implement UI components for:

- Resource type selection
- Form display and submission
- Registration progress indication
- Success/error notifications

## Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: All health data must be encrypted before storage
- **Access Control**: Only authorized users can register and access records
- **Data Integrity**: Hash verification ensures data hasn't been tampered with
- **Consent Management**: Patient consent status is tracked on the blockchain
- **Audit Trail**: All record operations are recorded on the blockchain

## Technical Details

### Encryption

We'll use AES-256-GCM symmetric encryption via the SymmetricCryptoService:

- Generate a secure encryption key
- Encrypt the FHIR resource data
- Store the encrypted data on IPFS

### IPFS Storage

We'll use the IPFSService for decentralized storage:

- Upload encrypted data to IPFS
- Retrieve the CID for blockchain registration
- Ensure data persistence through pinning

### Blockchain Registration

We'll use the DataRegistry smart contract via the useRegisterProducerRecord hook:

- Register the record with metadata (CID, URL, hash)
- Set appropriate record and consent status
- Handle transaction confirmation and errors

### Data Verification

We'll use the HashingService for data integrity:

- Generate SHA-256 hash of the encrypted data
- Store the hash on the blockchain
- Verify hash when retrieving data

## User Experience

The registration process should be:

- Intuitive for healthcare professionals
- Secure by default
- Efficient with minimal steps
- Transparent about data handling
- Compliant with healthcare regulations

## Implementation Timeline

1. Create the record registration page
2. Implement data processing service
3. Integrate secure storage functionality
4. Connect blockchain registration
5. Add user interface components
6. Test the complete workflow
7. Refine based on feedback

## Next Steps

After implementing the basic registration functionality:

- Add record retrieval capabilities
- Implement access control for different user roles
- Add consent management features
- Develop audit and reporting tools
