**Inherits:**
[ICompensation](/src/interface/ICompensation.sol/interface.ICompensation.md), Ownable, Pausable

The Compensation contract provides functionalities for processing payments,
withdrawing balances, adjusting service fees, and administrative actions.
It inherits from OpenZeppelin's Ownable and Pausable contracts for enhanced security and control.

_This contract manages the compensation payments to producers for the services rendered,
as well as service fees associated with these transactions._

## Functions

### constructor

_Initializes the Compensation contract._

```solidity
constructor(
    address _provider,
    address _tokenAddress,
    address payable _leveaWallet,
    uint256 _serviceFeePercent,
    uint256 _unitPrice
) Ownable(_provider);
```

**Parameters**

| Name                 | Type              | Description                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_provider`          | `address`         | The address of the provider who owns the contract.         |
| `_tokenAddress`      | `address`         | The address of the ERC20 token used for compensation.      |
| `_leveaWallet`       | `address payable` | The address of the wallet that will receive service fees.  |
| `_serviceFeePercent` | `uint256`         | The percentage of the service fee applied to transactions. |
| `_unitPrice`         | `uint256`         | The unit price for the services provided by the contract.  |

### processPayment

This function requires that the caller has previously approved the transfer of
tokens to this contract. If the token transfer fails, the transaction will revert.

It emits a [PaymentProcessed](/src/contracts/Compensation.sol/contract.Compensation.md#paymentprocessed) event upon successful payment processing,
containing details such as the producer's address, the sender's address, the
amount paid, and the service fee deducted.

_It processes a payment from the caller to the specified producer for the given record.
This function calculates the total payment amount based on the size of the data being
processed and the unit price defined in the contract. It ensures that the producer address
is valid and that the token transfer from the caller is successful. The function also
deducts a service fee from the payment amount, which is accumulated in the service fee balance.
Upon successful payment processing, it updates the producer's balance and records the
payment status for the specified record ID. An event is emitted to log the details of
the payment transaction._

_The service fee is calculated as a percentage of the total payment amount, and
the remaining balance after deducting the fee is credited to the producer's balance.
The payment status is recorded for the specified record ID, ensuring transparency
in payment transactions._

```solidity
function processPayment(address _producer, string memory _recordId, uint256 dataSize) public;
```

**Parameters**

| Name        | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_producer` | `address` | The address of the producer receiving the payment. Must not be a zero address.                                                                                               |
| `_recordId` | `string`  | The ID of the record for which the payment is being made. This ID will be used to track the payment status.                                                                  |
| `dataSize`  | `uint256` | The size of the data being processed, which determines the total payment amount to be transferred to the producer. The total amount is calculated as `dataSize * unitPrice`. |

### verifyPayment

This function is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state of the contract
and can be called for free without gas costs.

_This function verifies the payment status for a specified record.
It allows users to check if a payment has been successfully processed
for a given record ID. It retrieves the payment information from the internal
`payments` mapping and returns a boolean indicating whether the payment has been
marked as paid._

_It is important to ensure that the `_recordId` provided corresponds to a valid record
within the contract's payment system for accurate verification._

```solidity
function verifyPayment(string memory _recordId) public view returns (bool);
```

**Parameters**

| Name        | Type     | Description                                                             |

| -------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<none>` | `bool` | bool A boolean value indicating the payment status. Returns `true` if the payment for the specified record ID has been processed, and `false` otherwise. |

### withdrawProducerBalance

Allows a producer to withdraw a specified amount from their balance held in the contract.
This function ensures that the withdrawal meets the minimum withdrawal amount
and that the producer has sufficient balance. The operation is paused if the contract
is in a paused state.

_This function checks that the requested amount is above the minimum withdrawal threshold
and that the producer has enough balance to cover the withdrawal. If both conditions are met,
the function proceeds to transfer the tokens to the producer's address._

```solidity
function withdrawProducerBalance(uint256 _amount) public whenNotPaused;
```

**Parameters**

### withdrawServiceFee

Allows the contract owner to withdraw a specified amount of service fees from the contract.
The function checks that the requested withdrawal amount does not exceed the available service fee balance
and ensures that the contract is not paused before proceeding with the withdrawal.

_The call to this function is restricted to the contract owner. It validates that the requested amount
does not exceed the current service fee balance. If validation passes, the service fee amount is
deducted from the balance and transferred to the designated wallet._

```solidity
function withdrawServiceFee(uint256 _amount) public override onlyOwner whenNotPaused;
```

**Parameters**

| Name      | Type      | Description                                              |
