## Function Description

The function processes requests to set a minimum withdrawal amount. It calls the `setMinimumWithdrawAmount` function to execute the update and provides a receipt for the operation.

### Dependencies

- **setMinimumWithdrawAmount**: Helper function to update the minimum withdrawal amount in the payment system.

```typescript
import { setMinimumWithdrawAmount } from '../helpers/update-query';
```

## Handler Function

The handler function logs the request URL, attempts to set the minimum withdrawal amount, and sends the appropriate HTTP response.

### Key Logic

```typescript
const receipt = await setMinimumWithdrawAmount(value);
```

## Request and Response

### Request

The function expects a `POST` request at the `/setMinimumWithdrawAmount` route. The request body must contain the `value` parameter indicating the minimum amount to be set.

#### Request Example

```http
POST /setMinimumWithdrawAmount
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "value": 100
}
```

### Response

#### Successful Response (200 OK)

On success, the function returns a `200 OK` status with a JSON object containing the receipt of the operation.

```json
{
  "receipt": "transaction_receipt_here"
}
```

#### Error Response (500 Internal Server Error)

If there is an error during the process of setting the minimum withdrawal amount:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "message": "Failed to set minimum withdraw amount"
}
```

## Error Handling

The function logs any errors encountered during the update process and returns a `500` response with an error message.

### Error Snippet

```typescript
catch (error) {
  context.error(`Error setting minimum withdraw amount: ${error}`);
  return {
    status: 500,
    jsonBody: {
      error: error,
      message: 'Failed to set minimum withdraw amount',
    },
  };
}
```

## Route Configuration

The function is configured to respond to `POST` requests at the `/setMinimumWithdrawAmount` route and allows anonymous access.

### Route Setup

```typescript
app.http('setMinimumWithdrawAmount', {
  methods: ['POST'],
  route: 'setMinimumWithdrawAmount',
  authLevel: 'anonymous',
  handler,
});
```

## Summary

This Azure Function efficiently sets the minimum withdrawal amount for a payment system by securely handling the request and providing clear responses and error management.
