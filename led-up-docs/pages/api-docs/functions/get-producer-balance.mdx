## Function Description

The function is designed to handle `GET` requests and return the balance associated with a specified producer address. It utilizes the `getProducerBalanceByOwner` helper function to fetch the balance data.

### Dependencies

- **getProducerBalanceByOwner**: Helper function for retrieving the producer balance by owner address.

```typescript
import { getProducerBalanceByOwner } from '../helpers/view-query';
```

## Handler Function

The handler function logs the request URL, retrieves the producer balance for the specified owner address, and sends the appropriate HTTP response.

### Key Logic

```typescript
const address = (await request.query.get('address')) as string;
const balance = await getProducerBalanceByOwner(address);
return {
  status: 200,
  jsonBody: balance,
};
```

## Request and Response

### Request

The function expects a `GET` request at the `/getProducerBalance` route, with the owner address passed as a query parameter.

#### Request Example

```
GET /getProducerBalance?address=0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

### Response

#### Successful Response (200 OK)

On success, the function returns a `200 OK` status with the producer balance in the response body.

```json
{
  "balance": "1000"
}
```

#### Error Response (500 Internal Server Error)

If there is an error during the balance retrieval process:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "message": "Failed to get producer balance"
}
```

## Error Handling

The function logs any errors encountered during the retrieval process and returns a `500` response with an error message.

### Error Snippet

```typescript
catch (error) {
  context.error(`Error getting producer balance: ${error}`);
  return {
    status: 500,
    jsonBody: {
      error: error,
      message: 'Failed to get producer balance',
    },
  };
}
```

## Route Configuration

The function is set up to respond to `GET` requests at the `/getProducerBalance` route and allows anonymous access.

### Route Setup

```typescript
app.http('getProducerBalance', {
  methods: ['GET'],
  route: 'getProducerBalance',
  authLevel: 'anonymous',
  handler,
});
```

## Summary

This Azure Function provides an efficient way to retrieve the producer balance by owner address. It returns the balance in a structured format and handles errors gracefully, ensuring that users receive clear feedback in case of issues.
