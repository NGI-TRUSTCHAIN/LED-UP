## Overview

The DID Registry Service provides a TypeScript interface for interacting with the DidRegistry smart contract in the LEDUP ecosystem. This service manages Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on the blockchain, enabling secure identity management, document storage, and identity verification for all participants in the platform.

## Key Features

### DID Registration and Management

    subgraph Blockchain
        B -->|1. Submit Transaction| C[DidRegistry Contract]

        B -->|5. Resolve DID| C
        C -->|6. Return Document| B
        B -->|7. Return Document| E
    end
```

The service enables comprehensive DID management:

```typescript
// Register a new DID
const result = await didRegistryService.registerDid(
  'did:ledup:user123',
  JSON.stringify({subject: 'did:ledup:user123', attributes: {...}}),
  '0x04a591...'  // Public key
);
console.log(`DID registered: ${result.description}`);

// Update a DID document
const updateResult = await didRegistryService.updateDidDocument(
  'did:ledup:user123',
  JSON.stringify({subject: 'did:ledup:user123', attributes: {...}})
);
console.log(`DID document updated: ${updateResult.description}`);

// Deactivate a DID
const deactivateResult = await didRegistryService.deactivateDid('did:ledup:user123');
console.log(`DID deactivated: ${deactivateResult.description}`);
```

### DID Resolution and Verification

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Application
    participant DidRegistryService
    participant Contract

    Application->>DidRegistryService: getDocument(did)
    DidRegistryService->>Contract: Call getDocument method
    Contract->>Contract: Retrieve document
    Contract->>DidRegistryService: Return document
    DidRegistryService->>Application: Return document

    Application->>DidRegistryService: isDidActive(did)
    DidRegistryService->>Contract: Call isActive method
    Contract->>DidRegistryService: Return active status
    DidRegistryService->>Application: Return active status
```

The service provides methods to resolve and verify DIDs:

```typescript
// Retrieve a DID document
const document = await didRegistryService.getDocument('did:ledup:user123');
console.log(`DID document: ${document}`);

// Check if a DID exists
const exists = await didRegistryService.didExists('did:ledup:user123');
console.log(`DID exists: ${exists}`);

// Check if a DID is active
const isActive = await didRegistryService.isDidActive('did:ledup:user123');
console.log(`DID is active: ${isActive}`);

// Get the controller (owner) of a DID
const controller = await didRegistryService.getDidController('did:ledup:user123');
console.log(`DID controller: ${controller}`);
```

### Identity Resolution and Cryptographic Operations

    EmitDocumentUpdated --> [*]
    EmitPublicKeyUpdated --> [*]

    SignatureVerification --> RetrievePublicKey
    RetrievePublicKey --> VerifySignature
    VerifySignature --> ReturnVerificationResult
    ReturnVerificationResult --> [*]
```

The service enables identity resolution and cryptographic operations:

```typescript
// Get DID associated with an address
const didForAddress = await didRegistryService.getDidForAddress('0x1234567890AbCdEf1234567890aBcDeF12345678');
console.log(`DID for address: ${didForAddress}`);

// Get the public key for a DID
const publicKey = await didRegistryService.getPublicKeyForDid('did:ledup:user123');
console.log(`Public key: ${publicKey}`);

// Update the public key for a DID
const updateKeyResult = await didRegistryService.updateDidPublicKey(
  'did:ledup:user123',
  '0x04b691...' // New public key
);
console.log(`Public key updated: ${updateKeyResult.description}`);

// Verify a signature
const isValid = await didRegistryService.verifySignature(
  '0x1234567890AbCdEf1234567890aBcDeF12345678', // Address
  'Hello, world!', // Message
  '0x1a2b3c...' // Signature
);
console.log(`Signature verification: ${isValid ? 'Valid' : 'Invalid'}`);
```

## Error Handling

The DID Registry Service includes robust error handling through the `DidRegistryErrorHandler` class, which translates blockchain errors into user-friendly messages.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[API Call] -->|Try/Catch| B{Error Occurs?}
    B -->|No| C[Return Result]
    B -->|Yes| D[ErrorHandler]
    D -->|Contract Error?| E[Decode Custom Error]
    D -->|Standard Error| F[Format Standard Error]
    E --> G[Apply Context]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Return Formatted Error]
```

### Common Errors

The service handles the following contract-specific errors:

| Error Code                       | Description                   | User-Friendly Message                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DidRegistry__AlreadyRegistered` | DID already exists            | "DID already registered: This DID is already in use"                     |
| `DidRegistry__InvalidDID`        | DID format is invalid         | "Invalid DID: The DID format is invalid or does not exist"               |
| `DidRegistry__DeactivatedDID`    | DID has been deactivated      | "Deactivated DID: This DID has been deactivated and cannot be used"      |
| `DidRegistry__Unauthorized`      | Caller not authorized         | "Unauthorized: You are not authorized to perform this action on the DID" |
| `DidRegistry__InvalidPublicKey`  | Public key is invalid         | "Invalid public key: The provided public key is not valid"               |
| `DidRegistry__InvalidSignature`  | Signature verification failed | "Invalid signature: The provided signature could not be verified"        |

### Error Handling Example

```typescript
try {
  // Try to register a DID that already exists
  await didRegistryService.registerDid(
    'did:ledup:user123',
    JSON.stringify({ subject: 'did:ledup:user123' }),
    '0x04a591...'
  );
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
  // Output: "DID already registered: This DID is already in use"

  // Check for specific error type
  if (didRegistryService.isErrorType(error, 'DidRegistry__AlreadyRegistered')) {
    console.log('This DID is already registered in the system');
  }
}
```

## Event Parsing

The service includes a comprehensive event parsing system through the `DidRegistryEventParser` class, which transforms blockchain events into structured and informative data objects.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant DidRegistryService
    participant Blockchain
    participant EventParser

    App->>DidRegistryService: Call contract method
    DidRegistryService->>Blockchain: Submit transaction
    Blockchain->>Blockchain: Execute transaction
    Blockchain->>DidRegistryService: Return receipt with events
    DidRegistryService->>EventParser: Parse events
    EventParser->>EventParser: Process event data
    EventParser->>DidRegistryService: Return formatted events
    DidRegistryService->>App: Return structured result
```

### Supported Events

The service parses the following contract events:

| Event Name             | Description                             | Enriched Data                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `DIDRegistered`        | Emitted when a new DID is registered    | DID, controller, timestamp, description           |
| `DIDDocumentUpdated`   | Emitted when a DID document is updated  | DID, document hash, timestamp, description        |
| `DIDDeactivated`       | Emitted when a DID is deactivated       | DID, timestamp, description                       |
| `PublicKeyUpdated`     | Emitted when a public key is updated    | DID, new public key, timestamp, description       |
| `OwnershipTransferred` | Emitted when contract ownership changes | Previous owner, new owner, timestamp, description |

### Event Listening

The service provides a method to listen for events:

```typescript
// Listen for DID registration events
const unsubscribe = didRegistryService.listenForEvents(
  'DIDRegistered',
  {}, // Optional filter
  (event) => {
    console.log(`DID registered event: ${event.description}`);
    console.log(`DID: ${event.did}, Controller: ${event.controller}`);
  }
);

// Later, when done listening
unsubscribe();
```

## Integration Examples

### DID Registration and Management

```typescript
import { DidRegistryService } from './services/contracts';

// Initialize the service
const didRegistryService = new DidRegistryService('0x1234567890AbCdEf1234567890aBcDeF12345678', didRegistryAbi);

// Register a new DID with a document
async function registerNewDid(did, publicKey) {
  try {
    // Create a simple DID document
    const document = JSON.stringify({
      subject: did,
      controller: did,
      created: new Date().toISOString(),
      authentication: [
        {
          id: `${did}#keys-1`,
          type: 'EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019',
          publicKeyHex: publicKey,
        },
      ],
    });

    // Register the DID
    const result = await didRegistryService.registerDid(did, document, publicKey);
    console.log(`DID registered successfully: ${result.description}`);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error registering DID:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Update a DID document
async function updateDid(did, newAttributes) {
  try {
    // Get the current document
    const currentDocumentStr = await didRegistryService.getDocument(did);
    const currentDocument = JSON.parse(currentDocumentStr);

    // Update the document with new attributes
    const updatedDocument = {
      ...currentDocument,
      ...newAttributes,
      updated: new Date().toISOString(),
    };

    // Update the DID document
    const result = await didRegistryService.updateDidDocument(did, JSON.stringify(updatedDocument));

    console.log(`DID document updated: ${result.description}`);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating DID document:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### DID Verification and Resolution

```typescript
// Verify a DID exists and is active
async function verifyDid(did) {
  try {
    // Check if the DID exists
    const exists = await didRegistryService.didExists(did);

    if (!exists) {
      console.log(`DID ${did} does not exist`);
      return { exists: false, active: false };
    }

    // Check if the DID is active
    const isActive = await didRegistryService.isDidActive(did);
    console.log(`DID ${did} exists and is ${isActive ? 'active' : 'inactive'}`);

    // Get the controller
    const controller = await didRegistryService.getDidController(did);
    console.log(`DID ${did} is controlled by ${controller}`);

    return { exists, active: isActive, controller };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error verifying DID:', error.message);
    return { exists: false, active: false, error: error.message };
  }
}

// Resolve DID to document
async function resolveDid(did) {
  try {
    const document = await didRegistryService.getDocument(did);
    return {
      did,
      document: JSON.parse(document),
      found: true,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error resolving DID ${did}:`, error.message);

    // Check for specific error types
    if (didRegistryService.isErrorType(error, 'DidRegistry__InvalidDID')) {
      return { did, found: false, reason: 'DID not found' };
    } else if (didRegistryService.isErrorType(error, 'DidRegistry__DeactivatedDID')) {
      return { did, found: false, reason: 'DID is deactivated' };
    }

    return { did, found: false, reason: error.message };
  }
}
```

### Identity and Signature Verification

```typescript
// Get DID for an address and verify signature
async function verifyMessageFromAddress(address, message, signature) {
  try {
    // Get the DID for this address
    const did = await didRegistryService.addressToDID(address);

    if (!did) {
      return {
        verified: false,
        reason: 'No DID associated with this address',
      };
    }

    // Verify the signature
    const isValid = await didRegistryService.verifySignature(address, message, signature);

    return {
      verified: isValid,
      did,
      reason: isValid ? 'Signature valid' : 'Invalid signature',
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error verifying signature:', error.message);
    return { verified: false, reason: error.message };
  }
}

// Monitor DID events
function monitorDidActivity() {
  // Listen for DID registrations
  const unsubscribeRegistered = didRegistryService.listenForEvents('DIDRegistered', {}, (event) => {
    console.log(`New DID registered: ${event.did}`);
    console.log(`Controller: ${event.controller}`);
  });

  // Listen for DID document updates
  const unsubscribeUpdated = didRegistryService.listenForEvents('DIDDocumentUpdated', {}, (event) => {
    console.log(`DID document updated: ${event.did}`);
  });

  // Listen for DID deactivations
  const unsubscribeDeactivated = didRegistryService.listenForEvents('DIDDeactivated', {}, (event) => {
    console.log(`DID deactivated: ${event.did}`);
  });

  // Return function to stop all listeners
  return () => {
    unsubscribeRegistered();
    unsubscribeUpdated();
    unsubscribeDeactivated();
  };
}
```

## Summary

The DID Registry Service provides a robust interface for decentralized identity management in the LEDUP platform, enabling:

1. **Secure DID creation and management** through standardized identity operations
