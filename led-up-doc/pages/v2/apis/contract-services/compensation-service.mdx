**Status:** Production

## Overview

The Compensation Service provides a TypeScript interface for interacting with the Compensation smart contract in the LEDUP ecosystem. This service handles all payment processing between data consumers and producers, tracks balances, calculates service fees, and manages compensation for health data sharing.

## Key Features

### Payment Processing

```mermaid

    subgraph Consumer
        A[Application] -->|Process Payment| B[CompensationService]
    end
    subgraph Blockchain
        B -->|1. Send Transaction| C[Compensation Contract]
        C -->|2. Update Balances| C
        C -->|3. Emit Events| D[Blockchain Events]
    end
    subgraph Producer
        D -->|4. Receive Notification| E[Notification Service]
        C -->|5. Update Balance| F[Producer Wallet]
    end
```

The service enables secure payment processing with comprehensive transaction handling:

```typescript
// Process payment from consumer to producer
const result = await compensationService.processPayment({
  producer: '0x1234...', // Producer address
  recordId: 'record-123', // Record identifier
  dataSize: 1024, // Size of data in bytes
  consumerDid: 'did:ledup:consumer123', // DID of the consumer
});

// Result contains transaction details and event information
console.log(`Payment processed with transaction hash: ${result.transactionHash}`);
```

### Balance Management

    Note over Producer,Events: Balance Withdrawal Flow

    Producer->>CompensationService: withdrawProducerBalance(amount)
    CompensationService->>Contract: Call withdraw method
    Contract->>Contract: Verify balance & role
    Contract->>Contract: Transfer tokens
    Contract->>Events: Emit ProducerPaid event
    Events->>CompensationService: Parse event
    CompensationService->>Producer: Return formatted receipt
```

The service provides methods to manage producer balances and withdrawals:

```typescript
// Check producer's current balance
const balance = await compensationService.getProducerBalance('0x1234...');
console.log(`Current balance: ${balance} tokens`);

// Withdraw available funds
const withdrawalResult = await compensationService.withdrawProducerBalance(1000000000000000000n); // 1 token
console.log(`Withdrawal processed: ${withdrawalResult.description}`);
```

### Administration

    state ConfigureSystem {
        [*] --> ValidateOwnership
        ValidateOwnership --> ExecuteAdminFunction
        ExecuteAdminFunction --> [*]
    }
```

The service includes administrative functions for platform management:

```typescript
// Change service fee (admin only)
const feeResult = await compensationService.changeServiceFee(5); // 5% fee
console.log(`Service fee updated: ${feeResult.description}`);

// Change unit price (admin only)
const priceResult = await compensationService.changeUnitPrice(1500000000000000000n); // 1.5 tokens per unit
console.log(`Unit price updated: ${priceResult.description}`);

// Pause/unpause service (admin only)
await compensationService.pauseService();
await compensationService.unpauseService();
```

## Error Handling

The Compensation Service includes robust error handling through the `CompensationErrorHandler` class, which translates blockchain errors into user-friendly messages.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[API Call] -->|Try/Catch| B{Error Occurs?}
    B -->|No| C[Return Result]
    B -->|Yes| D[ErrorHandler]
    D -->|Contract Error?| E[Decode Custom Error]
    D -->|Standard Error| F[Format Standard Error]
    E --> G[Apply Context]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Return Formatted Error]
```

### Common Errors

The service handles the following contract-specific errors:

| Error Code                            | Description                         | User-Friendly Message                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Compensation__InsufficientBalance`   | User has insufficient balance       | "Insufficient balance: The account does not have enough balance to complete this operation" |
| `Compensation__TokenTransferFailed`   | ERC20 token transfer failed         | "Token transfer failed: The token transfer operation failed"                                |
| `Compensation__NoBalanceToWithdraw`   | No balance available for withdrawal | "No balance to withdraw: The account does not have any balance to withdraw"                 |
| `Compensation__InvalidProducer`       | Producer not registered or invalid  | "Invalid producer: The producer is invalid or not registered"                               |
| `Compensation__InvalidConsumer`       | Consumer not registered or invalid  | "Invalid consumer: The consumer is invalid or not registered"                               |
| `Compensation__MinimumWithdrawAmount` | Withdrawal below minimum amount     | "Minimum withdraw amount: The withdrawal amount is below the minimum allowed"               |

### Error Handling Example

```typescript
try {
  await compensationService.withdrawProducerBalance(100); // Too small amount
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
  // Output: "Minimum withdraw amount: The withdrawal amount is below the minimum allowed"
}
```

## Event Parsing

The service includes a comprehensive event parsing system through the `CompensationEventParser` class, which transforms blockchain events into structured and informative data objects.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant CompensationService
    participant Blockchain
    participant EventParser

    App->>CompensationService: Call contract method
    CompensationService->>Blockchain: Submit transaction
    Blockchain->>Blockchain: Execute transaction
    Blockchain->>CompensationService: Return receipt with events
    CompensationService->>EventParser: Parse events
    EventParser->>EventParser: Process event data
    EventParser->>CompensationService: Return formatted events
    CompensationService->>App: Return structured result
```

### Supported Events

The service parses the following contract events:

| Event Name            | Description                                        | Enriched Data                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PaymentProcessed`    | Emitted when a payment is processed                | Producer address, consumer address, amount, service fee, timestamp |
| `ProducerPaid`        | Emitted when a producer withdraws funds            | Producer address, amount, timestamp                                |
| `ServiceFeeWithdrawn` | Emitted when service fees are withdrawn            | Wallet address, amount, timestamp                                  |
| `ServiceFeeChanged`   | Emitted when the service fee percentage is changed | Old fee, new fee, initiator address                                |
| `UnitPriceChanged`    | Emitted when the unit price is changed             | Old price, new price, initiator address                            |
| `ProducerRemoved`     | Emitted when a producer is removed                 | Producer address, timestamp                                        |

### Event Listening

The service provides a method to listen for events:

```typescript
// Listen for payment events
const unsubscribe = compensationService.listenForEvents(
  'PaymentProcessed',
  { producer: '0x1234...' }, // Optional filter
  (event) => {
    console.log(`Payment processed: ${event.description}`);
    console.log(`Amount: ${event.amount}, Consumer: ${event._consumer}`);
  }
);

// Later, when done listening
unsubscribe();
```

      consumerDid: 'did:ledup:consumer456',
    });

    console.log('Payment successful:', receipt);
    console.log('Transaction hash:', receipt.transactionHash);
    console.log('Events:', receipt.events);

    // Verify the payment was recorded
    const isPaid = await compensationService.verifyPayment('health-record-123');
    console.log('Payment verified:', isPaid);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Payment failed:', error.message);
  }
}
```

### Producer Balance Management

```typescript
// Check and withdraw producer balance
async function manageProducerBalance() {
  try {
    // Get current balance
    const balance = await compensationService.getProducerBalance('0xMyAddress');
    console.log(`Current balance: ${balance}`);

    if (balance > 0) {
      // Withdraw available balance
      const withdrawalReceipt = await compensationService.withdrawProducerBalance(balance);
      console.log('Withdrawal successful:', withdrawalReceipt.description);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Balance management failed:', error.message);

}
```

### Administrative Functions

```typescript
// Administrative functions (owner only)
async function performAdminOperations() {
  try {
    // Update service fee to 3%
    await compensationService.changeServiceFee(3);

    // Get current service fee and balance
    const fee = await compensationService.getServiceFee();
    const feeBalance = await compensationService.getServiceFeeBalance();
    console.log(`Current fee: ${fee}%, Balance: ${feeBalance}`);

    // Withdraw service fees
    if (feeBalance > 0) {
      await compensationService.withdrawServiceFees(feeBalance);
    }
