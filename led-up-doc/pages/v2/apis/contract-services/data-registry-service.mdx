**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** March 2025  
**Status:** Production

## Overview

The Data Registry Service provides a TypeScript interface for interacting with the DataRegistry smart contract in the LEDUP ecosystem. This service manages the registration, updating, sharing, and verification of health data records on the blockchain, enabling secure and transparent control over sensitive health information.

## Key Features

### Record Management

        C -->|6. Grant/Deny Access| B
        B -->|7. Provide Data Access| E
    end
```

The service enables comprehensive data record management:

```typescript
// Register a new health record
const registerResult = await dataRegistryService.registerRecord(
  'record-123', // Record ID
  'QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTnXA5uC8pyEosXMC2nPkTEswqWXvKnU', // IPFS CID
  '0x4a5c8eb84f3a62e9398aa7a5c7eb92f10a0c8c91f896f363f8d2e6e797ac48c4', // Content hash
  ResourceType.HEALTH_RECORD, // Resource type
  5242880 // Data size (5MB)
);
console.log(`Record registered: ${registerResult.description}`);

// Update an existing record
const updateResult = await dataRegistryService.updateRecord(
  'record-123',
  'QmX9H87HCib3nMTMPgEA2CESJzm3iBBjtMJy8vvg8mNcQf', // New IPFS CID
  '0x6b9d4bf2e55ef9a6d2c3f353105618da27e6df33b8a25fe78baff68388536ae1' // New content hash
);
console.log(`Record updated: ${updateResult.description}`);
```

### Data Sharing

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Producer
    participant DataRegistryService
    participant Contract
    participant Consumer

    Producer->>DataRegistryService: shareData(recordId, consumerAddress, duration)
    DataRegistryService->>Contract: Call shareData method
    Contract->>Contract: Add access rights
    Contract->>Contract: Emit DataShared event
    Contract->>DataRegistryService: Return transaction receipt
    DataRegistryService->>Producer: Return formatted receipt

    Consumer->>DataRegistryService: triggerAccess(recordId)
    DataRegistryService->>Contract: Check access
    Contract->>DataRegistryService: Return access status
    DataRegistryService->>Consumer: Grant access if authorized
```

The service provides methods for sharing health records:

```typescript
// Share data with a consumer
const shareResult = await dataRegistryService.shareData(
  'record-123',
  '0x1234567890AbCdEf1234567890aBcDeF12345678', // Consumer address
  86400 // Access duration in seconds (24 hours)
);
console.log(`Data shared: ${shareResult.description}`);

// Share data with a service provider (with specific access level)
const providerShareResult = await dataRegistryService.shareToProvider(
  'record-123',
  '0xProviderAddress1234567890AbCdEf1234567890', // Provider address
  604800, // Access duration in seconds (7 days)
  AccessLevel.READ // Read-only access
);
console.log(`Data shared with provider: ${providerShareResult.description}`);

// Revoke access
const revokeResult = await dataRegistryService.revokeAccess(
  'record-123',
  '0x1234567890AbCdEf1234567890aBcDeF12345678' // Consumer address
);
console.log(`Access revoked: ${revokeResult.description}`);
```

### Access Verification

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RequestAccess

    RequestAccess --> CheckAccess

    CheckAccess --> AccessGranted: Has valid access
    CheckAccess --> AccessDenied: No access/Expired

    AccessGranted --> VerifyRecord
    VerifyRecord --> ReturnRecord
    ReturnRecord --> [*]

    AccessDenied --> ReturnError
    ReturnError --> [*]

    state CheckAccess {
        [*] --> CheckConsumer
        CheckConsumer --> CheckExpiration
        CheckExpiration --> CheckRevocation
        CheckRevocation --> [*]
    }
```

The service provides methods for verifying and managing access to records:

```typescript
// Trigger access to a shared record (for consumers)
const accessResult = await dataRegistryService.triggerAccess('record-123');
console.log(`Access triggered: ${accessResult.description}`);

// Check if a consumer has access to a record
const accessStatus = await dataRegistryService.checkAccess(
  'record-123',
  '0x1234567890AbCdEf1234567890aBcDeF12345678' // Consumer address
);

if (accessStatus.hasAccess && !accessStatus.isRevoked) {
  console.log(`Access granted until: ${new Date(accessStatus.expiration * 1000)}`);
  console.log(`Access level: ${AccessLevel[accessStatus.accessLevel]}`);
} else {
  console.log('Access denied');
}
```

### Producer Management

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is Producer Registered?}
    B -->|No| C[Register Producer]
    B -->|Yes| D[Manage Producer]

    C --> E[Register Producer Record]

    D --> F[Update Record]
    D --> G[Update Metadata]

    E --> J[Success]
    F --> J
    G --> J
    H --> J
    I --> J

    J --> K[End]
```

The service enables producer registration and management:

```typescript
// Register a new producer
const producerResult = await dataRegistryService.registerProducer(RecordStatus.ACTIVE, ConsentStatus.GRANTED);
console.log(`Producer registered: ${producerResult.description}`);

// Register a producer record
const recordResult = await dataRegistryService.registerProducerRecord({
  ownerDid: 'did:ledup:producer123',
  recordId: 'record-123',
  producer: '0xProducerAddress1234567890AbCdEf1234567890',
  signature: '0x123abc...',
  resourceType: ResourceType.HEALTH_RECORD,
  consent: ConsentStatus.GRANTED,
  metadata: { dataType: 'bloodwork', format: 'json' },
});
console.log(`Producer record registered: ${recordResult.description}`);

// Update producer consent status
const consentResult = await dataRegistryService.updateProducerConsent(
  '0xProducerAddress1234567890AbCdEf1234567890',
  ConsentStatus.REVOKED
);
console.log(`Producer consent updated: ${consentResult.description}`);
```

## Error Handling

The Data Registry Service includes robust error handling through the `DataRegistryErrorHandler` class, which translates blockchain errors into user-friendly messages.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[API Call] -->|Try/Catch| B{Error Occurs?}
    B -->|No| C[Return Result]
    B -->|Yes| D[ErrorHandler]
    D -->|Contract Error?| E[Decode Custom Error]
    D -->|Standard Error| F[Format Standard Error]
    E --> G[Apply Context]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Return Formatted Error]
```

### Common Errors

The service handles the following contract-specific errors:

| Error Code                              | Description             | User-Friendly Message                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DataRegistry__Unauthorized`            | Caller lacks permission | "Unauthorized: You do not have permission to perform this action"      |
| `DataRegistry__RecordNotFound`          | Record does not exist   | "Record not found: The specified record does not exist"                |
| `DataRegistry__ProducerNotRegistered`   | Producer not registered | "Producer not registered: The producer must be registered first"       |
| `DataRegistry__InvalidConsent`          | Invalid consent status  | "Invalid consent: Producer has not granted consent for this operation" |
| `DataRegistry__AccessDenied`            | Consumer lacks access   | "Access denied: You do not have access to this record"                 |
| `DataRegistry__AccessExpired`           | Access has expired      | "Access expired: Your access to this record has expired"               |
| `DataRegistry__RecordAlreadyRegistered` | Record already exists   | "Record already registered: A record with this ID already exists"      |

### Error Handling Example

```typescript
try {
  // Try to access a record without permission
  await dataRegistryService.triggerAccess('record-123');
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
  // Output: "Access denied: You do not have access to this record"

  // Check for specific error type
  if (dataRegistryService.isErrorType(error, 'DataRegistry__AccessDenied')) {
    console.log('You need to request access from the record owner');
  }
}
```

## Event Parsing

The service includes a comprehensive event parsing system through the `DataRegistryEventParser` class, which transforms blockchain events into structured and informative data objects.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant DataRegistryService
    participant Blockchain
    participant EventParser

    App->>DataRegistryService: Call contract method
    DataRegistryService->>Blockchain: Submit transaction
    Blockchain->>Blockchain: Execute transaction
    Blockchain->>DataRegistryService: Return receipt with events
    DataRegistryService->>EventParser: Parse events
    EventParser->>EventParser: Process event data
    EventParser->>DataRegistryService: Return formatted events
    DataRegistryService->>App: Return structured result
```

### Supported Events

The service parses the following contract events:

| Event Name           | Description                           | Enriched Data                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RecordRegistered`   | Emitted when a record is registered   | Record ID, producer, resource type, timestamp, description |
| `RecordUpdated`      | Emitted when a record is updated      | Record ID, new CID, content hash, timestamp, description   |
| `DataShared`         | Emitted when a record is shared       | Record ID, consumer, expiration, access level, description |
| `AccessRevoked`      | Emitted when access is revoked        | Record ID, consumer, timestamp, description                |
| `ProducerRegistered` | Emitted when a producer is registered | Producer address, status, consent, timestamp, description  |
| `ProducerUpdated`    | Emitted when a producer is updated    | Producer address, status, consent, timestamp, description  |
| `RecordVerified`     | Emitted when a record is verified     | Record ID, verifier, timestamp, description                |

### Event Listening

The service provides a method to listen for events:

```typescript
// Listen for data sharing events
const unsubscribe = dataRegistryService.listenForEvents(
  'DataShared',
  { recordId: 'record-123' }, // Optional filter
  (event) => {
    console.log(`Data shared event: ${event.description}`);
    console.log(`Shared with: ${event.consumer}, Expires: ${new Date(event.expiration * 1000)}`);
  }
);

// Later, when done listening
unsubscribe();
```

## Integration Examples

### Record Registration and Sharing

```typescript
import { DataRegistryService, ResourceType, ConsentStatus, AccessLevel } from './services/contracts';

// Initialize the service
const dataRegistryService = new DataRegistryService('0x1234567890AbCdEf1234567890aBcDeF12345678', dataRegistryAbi);

// Register and share a health record
async function registerAndShareRecord() {
  try {
    // First, register a new health record
    const recordId = `record-${Date.now()}`; // Generate unique ID
    const ipfsCid = 'QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTnXA5uC8pyEosXMC2nPkTEswqWXvKnU';
    const contentHash = '0x4a5c8eb84f3a62e9398aa7a5c7eb92f10a0c8c91f896f363f8d2e6e797ac48c4';

    const registerResult = await dataRegistryService.registerRecord(
      recordId,
      ipfsCid,
      contentHash,
      ResourceType.HEALTH_RECORD,
      1048576 // 1MB
    );

    console.log(`Record registered with ID: ${recordId}`);
    console.log(`Transaction hash: ${registerResult.transactionHash}`);

    // Share the record with a consumer
    const consumerAddress = '0xConsumerAddress1234567890AbCdEf1234567890';
    const accessDuration = 86400; // 24 hours in seconds

    const shareResult = await dataRegistryService.shareData(recordId, consumerAddress, accessDuration);

    console.log(`Record shared with ${consumerAddress}`);
    console.log(`Access expires: ${new Date(Date.now() + accessDuration * 1000)}`);

    return { recordId, consumerAddress, registerResult, shareResult };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error registering and sharing record:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Record Access and Verification

```typescript
// Access and verify a shared health record
async function accessAndVerifyRecord(recordId) {
  try {
    // Check record info first
    const recordInfo = await dataRegistryService.getRecordInfo(recordId);
    console.log('Record info:', recordInfo);

    // Trigger access (as consumer)
    const accessResult = await dataRegistryService.triggerAccess(recordId);
    console.log(`Access triggered: ${accessResult.description}`);

    // Verify the record (e.g., as a trusted verifier)
    const verifyResult = await dataRegistryService.verifyRecord(recordId);
    console.log(`Record verified: ${verifyResult.description}`);

    // Check verification status
    const isVerified = await dataRegistryService.isRecordVerified(recordId);
    console.log(`Verification status: ${isVerified ? 'Verified' : 'Not Verified'}`);

    return { accessResult, verifyResult, isVerified };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error accessing or verifying record:', error.message);

    // Check for specific errors
    if (dataRegistryService.isErrorType(error, 'DataRegistry__AccessDenied')) {
      console.log('You need to request access to this record');
    } else if (dataRegistryService.isErrorType(error, 'DataRegistry__AccessExpired')) {
      console.log('Your access to this record has expired');
    }

    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Producer Registration and Management

```typescript

      fields: [
        { name: 'patientId', type: 'string', required: true },
        { name: 'testResults', type: 'object', required: true },
        { name: 'timestamp', type: 'number', required: true },
