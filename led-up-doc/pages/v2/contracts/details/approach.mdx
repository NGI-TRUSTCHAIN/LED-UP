# Smart Contract Documentation Approach

This document outlines the step-by-step approach we'll take to document the smart contracts in the decentralized data sharing system.

## Documentation Approach

We'll follow a systematic approach to documenting each smart contract:

1. **Core Contract Analysis**
   - Review contract source code
   - Identify key components, functions, and relationships
   - Document contract purpose and responsibilities

2. **Interface Documentation**
   - Document the public interfaces
   - Explain function parameters and return values
   - Note access control requirements

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Document internal implementation
   - Explain design patterns used
   - Highlight security considerations

4. **Test Coverage Analysis**
   - Review test files
   - Document test coverage and scenarios
   - Identify edge cases and limitations

5. **Integration Points**
   - Document how contracts interact with each other
   - Explain the dependency chain
   - Highlight upgrade considerations

## Documentation Order

We'll document the contracts in the following order, based on dependencies:

1. **Foundation Contracts**
   - DidRegistry (manages identity)
   - Token (ERC20 implementation)

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - DidVerifier
   - DidIssuer
   - DidAuth

3. **Core System Contracts**
   - DataRegistry
   - Compensation
   - DataAccess

4. **Supporting Contracts**
   - Consent
   - DataSharing

## Contract Documentation Template

For each contract, we'll create a markdown file with the following sections:

```markdown
# ContractName

## Purpose and Responsibilities

Brief description of what the contract does and its role in the system.

## Contract Architecture

Explanation of the contract design, major components, and how they work together.

## Key Data Structures

Description of the important data structures used in the contract.

## Public Interface

### Functions

List and explain all public and external functions:

#### `functionName(type param) returns (type)`

- **Purpose**: What this function does
- **Access Control**: Who can call this function
- **Parameters**:
  - `param`: Description of parameter
- **Returns**: Description of return value
- **Events Emitted**: Any events emitted by this function
- **Errors**: Possible error conditions

### Events

List and explain all events:

#### `EventName(type indexed param, type param)`

- **Purpose**: When and why this event is emitted
- **Parameters**:
  - `param`: Description of parameter

### Errors

List and explain all custom errors:

#### `ContractName__ErrorName()`

- **Cause**: What causes this error
- **Solution**: How to resolve or avoid this error

## Implementation Details

Explanation of implementation specifics, algorithms, and design patterns.

## Security Considerations

Discussion of security aspects, including:
- Access control mechanisms
- Reentrancy protection
- Data validation
- Edge cases

## Integration Points

How this contract interacts with other contracts in the system.

## Test Coverage

Summary of test coverage and key test scenarios.

## Upgrade Considerations

Notes on potential upgrade paths and considerations.
```

## Next Steps

1. Create the documentation folder structure
2. Begin with DidRegistry documentation
3. Follow the dependency chain to document related contracts
4. Cross-reference contracts as they're documented
