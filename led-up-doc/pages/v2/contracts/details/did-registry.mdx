# DidRegistry

## Purpose and Responsibilities

The DidRegistry contract serves as the foundation for decentralized identity management in the data sharing system. It provides a secure way to register, update, and manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on the blockchain. The contract maintains the relationship between Ethereum addresses and their associated DIDs, enabling identity verification and authentication throughout the system.

Key responsibilities include:
- Registering new DIDs with associated documents and public keys
- Updating DID documents and public keys
- Managing DID lifecycle (activation/deactivation)
- Resolving DIDs to retrieve associated information
- Mapping between blockchain addresses and DIDs

## Contract Architecture

The DidRegistry implements a gas-optimized storage model for DIDs using hash-based mappings. It follows a straightforward approach where:

1. DIDs are stored as string representations (e.g., `did:method:network:address`)
2. For efficiency, the contract hashes DIDs and uses these hashes as keys in mappings
3. Each DID has an associated document containing identity information
4. The contract maintains bidirectional mappings between addresses and DIDs
5. The contract enforces that only the controller (owning address) of a DID can modify it

The design prioritizes gas efficiency and security while maintaining the standard DID format and capabilities.

## Key Data Structures

### DIDDocument

The primary data structure that holds DID information:

```solidity
struct DIDDocument {
    address subject;   // The controller/subject address
    uint40 lastUpdated; // Timestamp of last update
    bool active;       // Active status flag
    string publicKey;  // Public key string
    string document;   // Document string
}
```

### Storage Mappings

The contract uses the following mappings for efficient DID management:

```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => DIDDocument) internal didData;        // DID hash to document
mapping(address => bytes32) internal addressToDidHash;    // Address to DID hash
mapping(string => bytes32) internal didToHash;            // DID string to hash
mapping(bytes32 => string) internal hashToDid;            // DID hash to string
```

## Implementation Details

### Hash-Based Storage

The contract uses keccak256 hashing of DID strings for efficient storage:

```solidity
bytes32 didHash = keccak256(bytes(did));
```

This approach saves gas when dealing with repeated operations on the same DID.

### Bidirectional Mappings

The contract maintains bidirectional mappings between:
- DID strings and their hashes
- Addresses and DID hashes

This enables efficient lookups from either direction:
- Finding a DID when given an address
- Finding the controller when given a DID

### Internal Helper Functions

The contract uses internal helper functions to avoid code duplication:

- `_getDidHash(string calldata did)`: Gets hash from DID string
- `_getPublicKey(bytes32 didHash)`: Gets public key from hash
- `_getDocument(bytes32 didHash)`: Gets document from hash
- `_getSubject(bytes32 didHash)`: Gets subject from hash
- `_isActive(bytes32 didHash)`: Checks active status
- `_getLastUpdated(bytes32 didHash)`: Gets last update timestamp
- `_isController(bytes32 didHash)`: Checks if caller is controller
- `_exists(bytes32 didHash)`: Checks if DID exists

### Gas Optimization

The contract uses uint40 for timestamps to save storage space:

```solidity
uint40 lastUpdated; // Using 40 bits instead of 256 for timestamps
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- Only the controller of a DID can modify or deactivate it
- The contract verifies the caller against the registered controller address

### Data Validation

- The contract checks for DID existence before operations
- It verifies DID active status before allowing updates

### Potential Risks

- No mechanism to transfer DID ownership to another address
- If a controller loses access to their private key, they lose control of their DID
- No way to recover a DID if the controller address is compromised

## Integration Points

The DidRegistry is a foundational contract that integrates with:

1. **DidAuth**: Uses DidRegistry to authenticate DIDs and verify their active status
2. **DidVerifier**: Uses DidRegistry to access DID information for verification
3. **DataRegistry**: Uses DidRegistry indirectly through DidAuth for access control
4. **Compensation**: Uses DidAuth which depends on DidRegistry for DID verification

## Test Coverage

The DidRegistry is extensively tested in several test files:

1. `DidRegistry.reactivate.test.ts`: Tests deactivation and reactivation
2. Various integration tests in other contract tests:
   - `DidAuth1.test.ts`: Tests integration with authentication
   - `data-registry/TestCommon.ts`: Tests DID setup for data sharing
   - `DataRegistry1.test.ts`: Tests DID usage in data registry operations

Key test scenarios include:
- Registering new DIDs
- Updating DID documents and public keys
- Deactivating and reactivating DIDs
- Resolving DIDs
- Address to DID mapping

## Upgrade Considerations

The DidRegistry contract lacks explicit upgrade mechanisms. If upgrades are needed:

1. Deploy a new DidRegistry contract
2. Migrate DID data from the old contract to the new one
3. Update dependent contracts like DidAuth to use the new registry

Potential improvements in future versions:
- Add DID ownership transfer capability
- Add administrative recovery mechanisms
- Implement proxy pattern for easier upgrades
- Add batch operations for gas efficiency
