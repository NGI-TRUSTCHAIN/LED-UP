# DidIssuer

## Purpose and Responsibilities

The DidIssuer contract is responsible for issuing and tracking verifiable credentials within the decentralized identity system. It provides a simple mechanism for creating credentials associated with DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and verifying their validity.

Key responsibilities include:
- Issuing credentials to DIDs that are registered and active
- Tracking which credentials have been issued
- Verifying the validity of credentials
- Preventing duplicate credentials from being issued

## Contract Architecture

The DidIssuer implements a basic credential management system:

1. It maintains a registry of issued credentials using a mapping
2. It ensures that credentials are only issued to active DIDs
3. It prevents the same credential ID from being issued more than once
4. It emits events when credentials are issued for off-chain tracking

The design is intentionally minimal, focusing on basic credential management while relying on the DidRegistry for DID validation.

## Key Data Structures

### Storage Mappings

The contract uses a mapping to track issued credentials:

```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => bool) private issuedCredentials;
```

This maps a credential ID (bytes32 hash) to a boolean indicating whether the credential has been issued.

## Public Interface

### Functions

#### `constructor(address _didRegistryAddress)`

- **Purpose**: Initializes the DidIssuer with a reference to the DidRegistry contract
- **Parameters**:
  - `_didRegistryAddress`: The address of the deployed DidRegistry contract

#### `issueCredential(string calldata credentialType, string calldata subject, bytes32 credentialId)`

- **Purpose**: Issues a new credential to a subject DID
- **Access Control**: Public function without explicit restrictions
- **Parameters**:
  - `credentialType`: The type of credential being issued (e.g., "ProducerCredential")
  - `subject`: The DID of the subject receiving the credential
  - `credentialId`: Unique identifier for the credential
- **Events Emitted**: `CredentialIssued(credentialType, subject, credentialId, block.timestamp)`
- **Errors**:
  - `DidIssuer__InvalidSubject()`: Thrown if the subject DID is not active
  - `DidIssuer__CredentialAlreadyIssued()`: Thrown if the credential ID has already been used

#### `isCredentialValid(bytes32 credentialId)`

- **Purpose**: Checks if a credential has been issued and is valid
- **Parameters**:
  - `credentialId`: The unique identifier of the credential to check
- **Returns**: Boolean indicating if the credential is valid

### Events

#### `CredentialIssued(string credentialType, string subject, bytes32 credentialId, uint256 timestamp)`

- **Purpose**: Emitted when a new credential is issued
- **Parameters**:
  - `credentialType`: The type of credential issued
  - `subject`: The DID of the subject receiving the credential
  - `credentialId`: The unique identifier of the credential
  - `timestamp`: When the credential was issued

### Errors

#### `DidIssuer__InvalidSubject()`

- **Cause**: Attempting to issue a credential to an inactive or nonexistent DID
- **Solution**: Ensure the subject DID exists and is active in the DidRegistry

#### `DidIssuer__CredentialAlreadyIssued()`

- **Cause**: Attempting to issue a credential with an ID that has already been used
- **Solution**: Use a unique credential ID for each credential

## Implementation Details

The DidIssuer implements a simple credential issuance system with these key features:

1. **DID Validation**: Ensures credentials are only issued to active DIDs by checking with DidRegistry
2. **Unique Credential IDs**: Prevents duplicate credentials by tracking issuance status
3. **Event Logging**: Records credential issuance through events for off-chain systems

The implementation currently stores only the issuance status of credentials, with a comment indicating a future improvement to store credential content in IPFS with only the hash on-chain.

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- The `issueCredential` function lacks access control
- In a production system, this should be restricted to trusted issuers
- Without access control, any address can issue credentials

### Credential Content

- The contract only tracks whether a credential has been issued, not its content
- Credential content must be managed off-chain or via another mechanism
- A TODO comment indicates future plans to store credential content in IPFS

### Potential Risks

- No credential revocation mechanism
- No expiration mechanism for credentials
- No verification of issuer authority to issue specific credential types

## Integration Points

The DidIssuer integrates with:

1. **DidRegistry**: To verify if DIDs are active
2. **DidAuth**: Uses DidIssuer to track and verify credentials during authentication

In the test environment, we see the following usage pattern:
- DidIssuer is deployed with a reference to DidRegistry
- DidAuth is deployed with references to DidRegistry, DidVerifier, and DidIssuer
- Credentials are issued in tests before granting roles to DIDs
- Credential verification is performed by DidAuth using DidIssuer

## Test Coverage

The DidIssuer is primarily tested through its integration with DidAuth:

- Basic deployment in multiple test setups
- Credential issuance in test environment
- Credential validation through DidAuth

Key test scenarios include:
- Deployment and initialization with DidRegistry
- Issuing credentials to DIDs
- Verifying credentials through DidAuth

## Upgrade Considerations

The DidIssuer has several limitations that might require upgrades:

1. **Limited Access Control**: Add proper access controls for credential issuance
2. **Basic Credential Storage**: Implement IPFS integration as suggested in the TODO comment
3. **Missing Revocation**: Add capability to revoke issued credentials
4. **Missing Expiration**: Add expiration timestamps to credentials

For a production version, consider:
- Adding AccessControl for credential issuance
- Implementing credential expiration
- Adding credential revocation capabilities
- Storing credential content in IPFS as mentioned in the TODO comment
- Adding more detailed credential metadata
- Supporting different credential formats (e.g., W3C Verifiable Credentials)
