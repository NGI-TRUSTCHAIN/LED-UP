# Security Model

This document provides a detailed overview of the security model implemented in the decentralized data sharing system. The security architecture is designed to protect data integrity, ensure proper authentication and authorization, manage consent, and secure financial transactions.

## Core Security Principles

The system's security model is built upon the following core principles:

1. **Identity-Based Security**: All security starts with validated, verifiable identities
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions based on assigned roles
3. **Credential Verification**: Claims about identity verified through cryptographic credentials
4. **Explicit Consent**: Producer consent required for data sharing
5. **Payment Verification**: Access granted only after verified payment
6. **Minimal On-Chain Data**: Sensitive data stored off-chain with references on-chain
7. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protecting each operation

## Authentication Flow Using DIDs

### DID Authentication Process

The system implements a comprehensive DID-based authentication flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant DidRegistry
    participant DidAuth
    participant DidVerifier
    
    Client->>DidAuth: Request with DID and Credentials
    DidAuth->>DidRegistry: Check DID isActive()
    DidRegistry->>DidAuth: DID Status
    DidAuth->>DidVerifier: Verify Credential verifyCredential()
    DidVerifier->>DidAuth: Credential Status
    DidAuth->>DidAuth: Check Role hasDidRole()
    DidAuth->>Client: Auth Result
```

### Authentication Security Layers

1. **DID Validation**: Verifies DID exists and is active in DidRegistry
2. **Credential Verification**: Validates credentials using DidVerifier
3. **Role Verification**: Confirms the DID has the required role in DidAuth
4. **Issuer Trust Verification**: Ensures credentials come from trusted issuers

### Authentication Security Measures

- **Cryptographic Validation**: DID ownership verified through cryptographic means
- **Deactivation Checks**: Prevents authentication with deactivated DIDs
- **Status Tracking**: Maintains current status of DIDs and credentials
- **Event Logging**: Authentication attempts (success/failure) are logged via events

## Role-Based Authorization Mechanisms

### Role Hierarchy

The system implements a role-based authorization model with these primary roles:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    OWNER --> ADMIN
    ADMIN --> OPERATOR
    ADMIN --> ISSUER
    ADMIN --> VERIFIER
    OPERATOR --> PRODUCER
    OPERATOR --> CONSUMER
    ISSUER -.-> PRODUCER
    ISSUER -.-> CONSUMER
    VERIFIER -.-> PRODUCER
    VERIFIER -.-> CONSUMER
    
    style OWNER fill:#f96
    style ADMIN fill:#69f
    style OPERATOR fill:#9cf
    style ISSUER fill:#9cf
    style VERIFIER fill:#9cf
    style PRODUCER fill:#9f9
    style CONSUMER fill:#9f9
```

### Authorization Enforcement Points

Role-based authorization is enforced at multiple points:

1. **Function Level**: Through modifiers like `onlyOwner`, `withRole(ROLE)`, etc.
2. **Data Record Level**: Producer-specific access to their own records
3. **Payment Level**: Producer/consumer role validation during payments
4. **Administrative Actions**: Admin-only functions for system management

### Role Authorization Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant DidAuth
    participant TargetContract
    
    Client->>TargetContract: Call Function with DID
    TargetContract->>DidAuth: authenticate(did, requiredRole)
    DidAuth->>DidAuth: Role Check hasDidRole()
    DidAuth->>TargetContract: Authentication Result
    TargetContract->>TargetContract: If Authorized: Execute Function
    TargetContract->>Client: Function Result or Unauthorized
```

### Role-Credential Mapping

The system maps roles to required credential types:

| Role        | Required Credential      |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| PRODUCER    | ProducerCredential       |
| CONSUMER    | ConsumerCredential       |
| PROVIDER    | ProviderCredential       |
| ISSUER      | (Admin assigned)         |
| VERIFIER    | (Admin assigned)         |
| OPERATOR    | (Admin assigned)         |
| ADMIN       | (Owner assigned)         |

## Credential Verification Process

### Credential Structure

Credentials in the system include:

1. **Credential Type**: Defines the type of claim (e.g., ProducerCredential)
2. **Subject DID**: The DID that the credential is about
3. **Credential ID**: Unique identifier for the credential
4. **Issuer**: The entity that issued the credential

### Credential Verification Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant DidRegistry
    participant DidVerifier
    participant DidIssuer
    
    Client->>DidVerifier: Verify Credential Request
    DidVerifier->>DidVerifier: Check Issuer Trust isTrustedIssuer()
    DidVerifier->>DidRegistry: isActive(did)
    DidRegistry->>DidVerifier: DID Status
    DidVerifier->>DidIssuer: Verify Credential isCredentialValid()
    DidIssuer->>DidVerifier: Validity Result
    DidVerifier->>Client: Verification Result
```

### Credential Security Measures

1. **Trusted Issuer Registry**: Only credentials from registered trusted issuers are accepted
2. **Credential Validity Checks**: Ensures credentials haven't been revoked
3. **DID Active Verification**: Confirms the subject DID is active
4. **Credential Tracking**: Records which credentials have been issued to prevent duplication

## Data Privacy and Access Control Model

### Data Record Privacy

The system implements a multi-layered privacy approach:

1. **Minimal On-Chain Data**: Only metadata stored on-chain, actual data off-chain via IPFS
2. **Consent-Based Sharing**: Explicit producer consent required for sharing
3. **Time-Limited Access**: Access grants expire after specified duration
4. **Role-Based Access**: Only authorized roles can access specific functions
5. **Producer Control**: Producers maintain control over their data records

### Access Control Mechanisms

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Input Request] --> B{DID Active?}
    B -->|No| C[Access Denied]
    B -->|Yes| D{Has Required Role?}
    D -->|No| C
    D -->|Yes| E{Producer Consent Granted?}
    E -->|No| C
    E -->|Yes| F{Payment Verified?}
    F -->|No| C
    F -->|Yes| G[Access Granted]
```

### Data Access Layers

The system implements multiple access control layers:

1. **Authentication Layer**: Verifies identity through DIDs
2. **Authorization Layer**: Checks role-based permissions
3. **Consent Layer**: Verifies producer consent status
4. **Payment Layer**: Confirms payment has been processed
5. **Expiration Layer**: Enforces time-based access limitations

## Secure Payment Handling

### Payment Security Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Consumer
    participant DidAuth
    participant Compensation
    participant Token
    
    Consumer->>Compensation: Process Payment Request
    Compensation->>DidAuth: authenticate()
    DidAuth->>Compensation: Role Result
    Compensation->>DidAuth: authenticate()
    DidAuth->>Compensation: Role Result
    Compensation->>Token: transferFrom()
    Token->>Compensation: Transfer Result
    Compensation->>Compensation: Record Payment
    Compensation->>Consumer: Payment Result
```

### Payment Security Measures

1. **Role Verification**: Ensures payment participants have appropriate roles
2. **SafeERC20**: Uses OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 for secure token transfers
3. **Payment Records**: Maintains record of payments for verification
4. **Fee Handling**: Securely calculates and collects service fees
5. **Balance Management**: Safely tracks producer balances

### Withdrawal Security

Producer balance withdrawals implement these security features:

1. **Minimum Withdrawal Amount**: Prevents dust attacks and excessive gas costs
2. **Balance Verification**: Ensures sufficient balance before withdrawal
3. **Role Verification**: Confirms withdrawer has producer role
4. **Address Validation**: Prevents withdrawals to invalid addresses
