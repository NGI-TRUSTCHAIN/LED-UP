## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the zero-knowledge proof circuits used in the LedUp platform. These circuits enable privacy-preserving verification of sensitive data without revealing the underlying information.

## Available Circuits

The following circuits are currently implemented:

### `AgeVerifier.circom`

A circuit for proving age-related claims (over/under a threshold, age bracket) without revealing the actual birth date.

```circom
// Usage example
component main { public [currentDate, threshold, verificationType] } = AgeVerifier();
```

### `HashVerifier.circom`

A circuit that proves knowledge of data corresponding to a specific Poseidon hash without revealing the original data.

```circom
// Usage example
component main { public [expectedHash] } = EnhancedHashVerifier();
```

### `FhirVerifier.circom`

A circuit that verifies various aspects of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data, such as resource type, field validation, and content verification.

```circom
// Usage example
component main { public [resourceType, expectedHash, verificationMode] } = EnhancedFhirVerifier();
```

## Documentation Structure

- **[Installation and Setup](./installation-and-setup.md)**: Setting up the environment, compiling circuits, and generating keys.
- **[Circuits Overview](./circuits.md)**: Summary of all circuits and their functions.
- **[Age Verification](./age-verification.md)**: Detailed documentation for the `AgeVerifier` circuit.
- **[Hash Verification](./hash-verification.md)**: Detailed documentation for the `HashVerifier` circuit.
- **[FHIR Verification](./fhir-verification.md)**: Detailed documentation for the `FhirVerifier` circuit.

## Getting Started

To start working with these circuits:

1. Set up the circom environment following the [installation guide](./installation-and-setup.md)
2. Compile the circuits using the provided setup scripts
3. Run the test suite to verify circuit functionality
4. Integrate the circuits into your application using the generated artifacts

For detailed usage examples and input/output specifications, refer to the individual circuit documentation pages.
