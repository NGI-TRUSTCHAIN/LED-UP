## Function Description

The function processes requests to remove a producer record. It takes the producer's address from the request body and calls the `removeProducerRecord` function to execute the removal.

### Dependencies

- **removeProducerRecord**: Helper function for removing the producer record from the database.
- **stringifyBigInt**: Utility function for handling BigInt serialization.

```typescript
import { removeProducerRecord } from '../helpers/update-query';
import { stringifyBigInt } from '../helpers/bigIntStringify';
```

## Handler Function

The handler function logs the request URL, retrieves the producer's address from the request body, attempts to remove the producer record, and sends the appropriate HTTP response.

### Key Logic

```typescript
const data = (await request.json()) as { producer: string };
const receipt = await removeProducerRecord(data.producer);
```

## Request and Response

### Request

The function expects a `POST` request at the `/removeProducerRecord` route with the following body:

#### Request Example

```json
{
  "producer": "0xProducerAddress"
}
```

### Response

#### Successful Response (200 OK)

On success, the function returns a `200 OK` status with a JSON object containing the receipt of the removal operation.

```json
{
  "receipt": "removal_receipt_here"
}
```

#### Error Response (500 Internal Server Error)

If there is an error during the removal process:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "message": "Failed to retrieve data from IPFS"
}
```

## Error Handling

The function logs any errors encountered during the removal process and returns a `500` response with an error message.

### Error Snippet

```typescript
catch (error) {
  context.error(`Error fetching data: ${error}`);
  return {
    status: 500,
    jsonBody: {
      error: error,
      message: 'Failed to retrieve data from IPFS',
    },
  };
}
```

## Route Configuration

The function is configured to respond to `POST` requests at the `/removeProducerRecord` route and allows anonymous access.

### Route Setup

```typescript
app.http('removeProducerRecord', {
  methods: ['POST'],
  route: 'removeProducerRecord',
  authLevel: 'anonymous',
  handler,
});
```

## Summary

This Azure Function efficiently removes a producer record by securely handling the provided producer address and providing clear responses and error management.
