## Function Description

The function processes requests to renounce ownership. It calls the `renounceOwnership` function to execute the renunciation and provides a receipt for the operation.

### Dependencies

- **renounceOwnership**: Helper function to execute the ownership renunciation process.

```typescript
import { renounceOwnership } from '../helpers/update-query';
```

## Handler Function

The handler function logs the request URL, attempts to renounce ownership, and sends the appropriate HTTP response.

### Key Logic

```typescript
const receipt = await renounceOwnership();
```

## Request and Response

### Request

The function expects a `POST` request at the `/renounceOwnership` route. There is no specific body requirement for this request.

#### Request Example

```http
POST /renounceOwnership
```

### Response

#### Successful Response (200 OK)

On success, the function returns a `200 OK` status with a JSON object containing the receipt of the ownership renunciation operation.

```json
{
  "receipt": "ownership_renunciation_receipt_here"
}
```

#### Error Response (500 Internal Server Error)

If there is an error during the ownership renunciation process:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "message": "Failed to retrieve data from IPFS"
}
```

## Error Handling

The function logs any errors encountered during the ownership renunciation process and returns a `500` response with an error message.

### Error Snippet

```typescript
catch (error) {
  context.error(`Error fetching data: ${error}`);
  return {
    status: 500,
    jsonBody: {
      error: error,
      message: 'Failed to retrieve data from IPFS',
    },
  };
}
```

## Route Configuration

The function is configured to respond to `POST` requests at the `/renounceOwnership` route and allows anonymous access.

### Route Setup

```typescript
app.http('renounceOwnership', {
  methods: ['POST'],
  route: 'renounceOwnership',
  authLevel: 'anonymous',
  handler,
});
```

## Summary

This Azure Function efficiently renounces ownership of a smart contract or resource by securely handling the request and providing clear responses and error management.
