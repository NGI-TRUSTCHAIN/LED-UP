## Function Description

The function processes requests to verify the existence of a producer based on a provided address. It retrieves the producer's address from the query parameters and checks its existence in the database.

### Dependencies

- **producerExists**: Helper function that queries the database to determine if a producer exists.

```typescript
import { producerExists } from '../helpers/view-query';
```
````

## Handler Function

The handler function logs the request URL, retrieves the producer address from the query parameters, checks if the producer exists, and sends the appropriate HTTP response.

### Key Logic

```typescript
const producer = (await request.query.get('producer')) as string;
const isProducerExist = await producerExists(producer);
```

## Request and Response

### Request

The function expects a `GET` request at the `/producerExists` route with the following query parameter:

#### Request Example

```
GET /producerExists?producer=0xProducerAddress
```

### Response

#### Successful Response (200 OK)

On success, the function returns a `200 OK` status with a JSON object indicating the existence of the producer.

```json
{
  "isProducerExist": true // or false
}
```

#### Error Response (500 Internal Server Error)

If there is an error during the process:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "message": "Failed to retrieve data from IPFS"
}
```

## Error Handling

The function logs any errors encountered during the existence check and returns a `500` response with an error message.

### Error Snippet

```typescript
catch (error) {
  context.error(`Error fetching data: ${error}`);
  return {
    status: 500,
    jsonBody: {
      error: error,
      message: 'Failed to retrieve data from IPFS',
    },
  };
}
```

## Route Configuration

The function is configured to respond to `GET` requests at the `/producerExists` route and allows anonymous access.

### Route Setup

```typescript
app.http('CheckProducerExists', {
  methods: ['GET'],
  route: 'producerExists',
  authLevel: 'anonymous',
  handler,
});
```

## Summary

This Azure Function efficiently verifies the existence of a producer in the system based on the provided address, returning a clear JSON response and error reporting for any issues that may arise.
