## Function Description

The function processes `POST` requests to transfer ownership of a specified resource to a new provider. The new provider's address is provided in the request body.

### Dependencies

- **transferOwnership**: A helper function that executes the ownership transfer process.

```typescript
import { transferOwnership } from '../helpers/update-query';
```

## Handler Function

The handler function logs the request URL, processes the transfer request, and sends the appropriate HTTP response based on the outcome.

### Key Logic

1. **Extracting New Provider**:

   ```typescript
   const { newProvider } = (await request.json()) as { newProvider: string };
   ```

2. **Ownership Transfer**:
   ```typescript
   const receipt = await transferOwnership(newProvider);
   ```

## Request and Response

### Request

The function expects a `POST` request at the `/transferOwnership` route. The request body must contain the following parameter:

- **newProvider**: The address of the new provider to whom ownership is being transferred.

#### Request Example

```http
POST /transferOwnership
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "newProvider": "new_provider_address"
}
```

### Response

#### Successful Response (200 OK)

On success, the function returns a `200 OK` status with a JSON object containing the receipt of the ownership transfer.

```json
{
  "receipt": "transaction_receipt_here"
}
```

#### Error Response (500 Internal Server Error)

If an error occurs during the ownership transfer process, the function returns a `500 Internal Server Error` status with details about the error.

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "message": "Failed to retrieve data from IPFS"
}
```

## Error Handling

The function logs any errors encountered during the ownership transfer process. It returns a `500` response with the error details.

### Error Snippet

```typescript
catch (error) {
  context.error(`Error transferring ownership: ${error}`);
  return {
    status: 500,
    jsonBody: {
      error,
      message: 'Failed to retrieve data from IPFS',
    },
  };
}
```

## Route Configuration

The function is configured to respond to `POST` requests at the `/transferOwnership` route and allows anonymous access.

### Route Setup

```typescript
app.http('transferOwnership', {
  methods: ['POST'],
  route: 'transferOwnership',
  authLevel: 'anonymous',
  handler,
});
```

## Summary

This Azure Function efficiently facilitates the transfer of ownership of a resource to a new provider, handling potential errors gracefully and providing clear feedback to users.
