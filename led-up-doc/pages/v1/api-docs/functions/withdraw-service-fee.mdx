## Function Description

The function allows for the withdrawal of a service fee from the system. It processes incoming requests, executes the withdrawal operation, and returns the result.

### Dependencies

- **withdrawServiceFee**: A helper function to handle the withdrawal operation.
- **decodeError**: A utility function to decode error messages.
- **CompensationABI**: ABI required for decoding errors.

```typescript
import { withdrawServiceFee } from '../helpers/update-query';
import { decodeError } from '../helpers/decodeError';
import { CompensationABI } from '../utils/compensation.abi';
```

## Handler Function

The `handler` function logs the incoming request and processes the withdrawal operation.

### Key Logic

1. **Processing the Request**:
   The function expects a JSON body structured according to the `ValueParam` type, which contains the amount to withdraw.

   ```typescript
   const { value } = (await request.json()) as ValueParam;
   ```

2. **Withdrawing Service Fee**:
   The function calls `withdrawServiceFee` with the provided value and retrieves the transaction receipt.

   ```typescript
   const receipt = await withdrawServiceFee(value);
   ```

## Request and Response

### Request

The function expects a `POST` request at the `/withdrawServiceFee` route with a JSON body structured according to the `ValueParam` type.

#### Request Example

```http
POST /withdrawServiceFee
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "value": 50
}
```

### Response

#### Successful Response (200 OK)

On a successful withdrawal, the function returns a `200 OK` status with the transaction receipt.

```json
{
  "receipt": "transaction_receipt_here"
}
```

#### Error Response (500 Internal Server Error)

If an error occurs during the withdrawal process, the function returns a `500 Internal Server Error` status with the error details.

```json
{
  "error": "Decoded error message",
  "message": "Failed to withdraw the service fee"
}
```

## Error Handling

The function logs any errors encountered during the withdrawal process and returns a `500` response with the decoded error details.

### Error Snippet

```typescript
catch (error) {
  context.error(`Error withdrawing service fee: ${error}`);
  return {
    status: 500,
    jsonBody: {
      error: decodeError(CompensationABI, error), // Decode the error message
      message: 'Failed to withdraw the service fee',
    },
  };
}
```

## Route Configuration

The function is configured to respond to `POST` requests at the `/withdrawServiceFee` route and allows anonymous access.

### Route Setup

```typescript
app.http('withdrawServiceFee', {
  methods: ['POST'], // Only supports POST requests
  route: 'withdrawServiceFee', // The route for this function
  authLevel: 'anonymous', // No authentication required
  handler,
});
```

## Summary

This Azure Function efficiently manages the withdrawal of a service fee, ensuring robust error handling and informative responses to the users.
