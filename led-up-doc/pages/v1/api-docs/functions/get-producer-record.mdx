## Function Description

The function is designed to handle `GET` requests and return the record data for a specified producer address and record ID. It utilizes the `getProducerRecord` helper function to fetch the record data.

### Dependencies

- **getProducerRecord**: Helper function for retrieving the record associated with a producer.

```typescript
import { getProducerRecord } from '../helpers/view-query';
```

## Handler Function

The handler function logs the request URL, retrieves the record for the specified producer and record ID, and sends the appropriate HTTP response.

### Key Logic

```typescript
const producer = (await request.query.get('producer')) as string;
const recordId = (await request.query.get('recordId')) as string;
const record = await getProducerRecord(producer, recordId);
return {
  status: 200,
  jsonBody: {
    record,
  },
};
```

## Request and Response

### Request

The function expects a `GET` request at the `/getProducerRecord` route, with the producer address and record ID passed as query parameters.

#### Request Example

```
GET /getProducerRecord?producer=0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678&recordId=record123
```

### Response

#### Successful Response (200 OK)

On success, the function returns a `200 OK` status with the record data in the response body.

```json
{
  "record": {
    // record data structure
  }
}
```

#### Error Response (500 Internal Server Error)

If there is an error during the record retrieval process:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "message": "Failed to retrieve producer record"
}
```

## Error Handling

The function logs any errors encountered during the retrieval process and returns a `500` response with an error message.

### Error Snippet

```typescript
catch (error) {
  context.error(`Error fetching data: ${error}`);
  return {
    status: 500,
    jsonBody: {
      error: error,
      message: 'Failed to retrieve producer record',
    },
  };
}
```

## Route Configuration

The function is set up to respond to `GET` requests at the `/getProducerRecord` route and allows anonymous access.

### Route Setup

```typescript
app.http('getProducerRecord', {
  methods: ['GET'],
  route: 'getProducerRecord',
  authLevel: 'anonymous',
  handler,
});
```

## Summary

This Azure Function provides an efficient way to retrieve a specific record associated with a producer. It returns the record data in a structured format and handles errors gracefully, ensuring that users receive clear feedback in case of issues.
