## Overview

This Azure Function facilitates data sharing between a producer and a consumer after verifying that a payment has been successfully made.

## Function Description

The function processes requests to share data between a producer and a consumer. It verifies the payment associated with a given record ID before allowing data sharing.

### Dependencies

- **shareData**: Helper function to execute the data sharing process.
- **verifyPayment**: Helper function to verify if the payment associated with the record ID is valid.
- **decodeError**: Helper function to decode errors for better understanding.
- **CompensationABI**: ABI for managing compensation processes.
- **DataRegistryABI**: ABI for interacting with the data registry smart contract.

```typescript
import { CompensationABI } from '../utils/compensation.abi';
import { DataRegistryABI } from '../utils/dataRegistry.abi';
import { shareData } from '../helpers/update-query';
import { verifyPayment } from '../helpers/view-query';
import { decodeError } from '../helpers/decodeError';
```

## Handler Function

The handler function logs the request URL, processes the data sharing request, verifies the payment, and sends the appropriate HTTP response.

### Key Logic

1. **Payment Verification**:

   ```typescript
   const verified = await verifyPayment(body.recordId);
   ```

2. **Data Sharing**:
   ```typescript
   const receipt = await shareData(body.producer, body.consumer, body.recordId);
   ```

## Request and Response

### Request

The function expects a `POST` request at the `/shareData` route. The request body must contain the following parameters:

- **producer**: The address of the producer.
- **consumer**: The address of the consumer.
- **recordId**: The ID of the record being shared.

#### Request Example

```http
POST /shareData
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "producer": "producer_address",
  "consumer": "consumer_address",
  "recordId": "record_id"
}
```

### Response

#### Successful Response (200 OK)

On success, the function returns a `200 OK` status with a JSON object containing the receipt of the sharing operation.

```json
{
  "receipt": "transaction_receipt_here"
}
```

#### Error Responses

1. **Payment Not Verified (400 Bad Request)**

If the payment cannot be verified:

```json
{
  "message": "Payment not verified"
}
```

2. **Internal Server Error (500 Internal Server Error)**

If an error occurs during the data sharing process:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message",
  "parsed": "Parsed error message",
  "message": "Failed to share resource"
}
```

## Error Handling

The function logs any errors encountered during the payment verification or data sharing processes. It returns a `500` response with the error details.

### Error Snippet

```typescript
catch (error: any) {
  context.error(`Error sharing Data: ${error}`);
  console.error(decodeError(DataRegistryABI, error));

  return {
    status: 500,
    jsonBody: {
      error,
      parsed: decodeError(DataRegistryABI, error),
      message: 'Failed to share resource',
    },
  };
}
```

## Route Configuration

The function is configured to respond to `POST` requests at the `/shareData` route and allows anonymous access.

### Route Setup

```typescript
app.http('shareData', {
  methods: ['POST'],
  route: 'shareData',
  authLevel: 'anonymous',
  handler,
});
```

## Summary

This Azure Function efficiently facilitates data sharing between a producer and a consumer after confirming that the necessary payment has been made. It handles potential errors gracefully and provides clear feedback to users.
